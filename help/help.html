	<h2><a name="overview">Short overview</a></h2>
	<p>PeerSquared consists of three main parts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The whiteboard including the home button and toolbar on top</li>
		<li>A webcam and text chat on the right of the screen</li>
		<li>A function to exchange files (integrated in the text chat)</li>
	</ul>

	<notice>
	Only the teacher can use the whiteboard and sees the toolbar, but he can give control to the student (also see the heading 'Other functions')
	</notice>

	<h2><a name="whiteboard">The whiteboard</a></h2>
	<p>
		The whiteboard is a bit like the old school whiteboard, but with a lot more possibilities. The teacher can draw with a pencil on the whiteboard, but also has the ability to create shapes, add pictures and type text onto the whiteboard. <br />
	</p>
	<a class="up" href="#contents">Contents</a>

	<h3><a name="whiteboard_actions">Whiteboard actions</a></h3>
	<img src="help/images/buttons1.png" />
	  <p>
		The main actions of the whiteboard can be controlled with a couple of buttons like in the image above. The left button is the undo-button <span style="font-size:10px">1</span>, and can be used to undo any action on the whiteboard (alternatively use the key combination Ctrl-U).  
	 </p>
	 <p>
		When you select the next arrow-button <span style="font-size:10px">2</span> (or key combination CTRL-E) you will see that the mouse cursor becomes green. In this mode you are able to show something to the student: the student will see the same green cursor. Holding the left mouse button down on the whiteboard in this mode will change  the the cursor color. This is useful when you want to point at something.
	</p>
	<p>
		Selecting the next text-button <span style="font-size:10px">3</span> will allow you to type text onto the whiteboard. When you click on the whiteboard you will see a blue box appear in which you can type your text. The black 'color picker' button and the two menu boxes, like in the picture below, can be used to make up the color, style and size of the text. The text will only appear on the whiteboard after you click outside the blue box. So the student will also only see the final result. Note that you can move the box by dragging the icon in the upper right corner, and resize it by dragging the icon in the lower right corner. 
	</p>
	<img src="help/images/buttons2.png" /> 
	<p>
	The next pencil-button <span style="font-size:10px">4</span> (or Ctrl-D) allows you to draw onto the whiteboard. The color-picker button can also be used for selection a pencil color. In addition you can click on the button the right of the color picker to choose the line width of your pencil. When you finish a pencil stroke the student will see the result, so he won't actually see you doing the drawing itself.
	</p>
	<p>Select the most right shape-button <span style="font-size:10px">5</span> (or Ctrl-S) to create a number of shapes on the whiteboard. You can select a specific shape by clicking on the shape picker button which is located on the left of the font type selector. When you finish a shape stroke the student will see the result, so he won't actually see you doing the drawing itself.
	</p>
	<a class="up" href="#contents">Contents</a>

	<h3><a name="whiteboard_images">Adding images to the whiteboard</a></h3>
	<p>
		There is not quick button for adding images, but you can simple drag an image from your computer onto the whiteboard (alternatively you can select the option 'add image to whiteboard' from the start menu). After you do this you will see the image on the whiteboard surrounded by a blue lined box. This means you resize the image still by the handle in the right lower corner or move it by dragging it on any other point. Note that you will need to click outside the blue lined box the really add the image to the whiteboard. Again, the student will only see the result.
	</p>
	<tip>
		If you make a screenshot by Ctrl-PrintScreen you can also add it to the canvas by pasting it through the key combination Ctrl-V.
	</tip>

	<h3><a name="whiteboard_background">Changing the whiteboard background</a></h3>
	<img src="help/images/buttons3.png" />  
	<p>
	There are a couple of backgrounds that are predefined for you to use. By selecting the BG-button (see image) you can pick one. Alternatively you can select an image from your computer and drop it on top of the button, and you will have your own whiteboard background image. The student will see the result immediately. Note that this can't be undone like the previous actions, but you can simply choose another one. 
	</p>
	<a class="up" href="#contents">Contents</a>

	<h2><a name="webcam">Webcam and text chat</a></h2>
	<img src="help/images/buttons4.png" /> 
	<p>The webcam and text chat support the whiteboard teaching. On the right of the whiteboard are two black boxes. If you want to enable your webcam you select the camera button above them. 
	<notice>
	Important: for security reasons you will see a pop up box that will ask you to share your cam and microphone. So you have to click 'share selected devices' to really enable your cam.
	</notice>
	Your webcam will start playing in the upper black black box, your student's cam in the lower one. To disable your web cam click the camera button one more time. To access webcam chat in fullscreen mode choose the button right to the camera button.
	</p>
	<img src="help/images/buttons5.png" /> 
	<p>
	In the white text box next to the send button (see picture above) you can write a message and send it to the other by clicking the send buton. Alternatively you can use the key combination Ctrl-Enter for that.
	</p>
	<a class="up" href="#contents">Contents</a>	

	<h2><a name="sending">Sending a file</a></h2>
	<p>
	To send a file to the other you can drag it from your computer and drop it onto the text box. It is then offered to the other who either accept or declines it.
	</p>
	<a class="up" href="#contents">Contents</a>

	<h2><a name="other">Other functions</a></h2>
	<img src="help/images/buttons6.png"/>
	<p>
	Clicking on the home-button will open a menu with some more functions. These differ between teacher and student and are quite self explanatory. There is one important option only available to the teacher: 'delegate control'. Selecting this option allows the teacher to give the student control of the whiteboard and toolbar (only one has this privilige at the same time). When the student has control the teacher can get it back by selecting 'take back control' in the menu.
